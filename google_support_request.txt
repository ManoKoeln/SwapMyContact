Subject: Unable to Upload Android App Bundle (AAB) to Internal Testing Track - 50+ Failed Attempts

Dear Google Play Console Support Team,

I am experiencing a critical issue with uploading Android App Bundles (AAB) to the Internal Testing track for my app "SwapMyContact" (Package: com.businesscard2025.swapcontactnew).

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
Despite multiple attempts (50+ uploads over several days), I am unable to successfully upload new AAB files to the Internal Testing track. Each upload attempt fails with the following error message:

"You uploaded an APK or Android App Bundle that is signed as debuggable or for testing purposes only."

INVESTIGATION RESULTS:
I have thoroughly investigated this issue and confirmed that:
- The AAB manifest contains `android:testOnly="true"` attribute
- This attribute is NOT present in our source AndroidManifest.xml files
- The attribute is NOT set in our build.gradle configuration
- buildTypes.release has `debuggable = false` correctly set
- We build using `./gradlew bundlePlayRelease` (release variant, not debug)

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
After extensive investigation using bundletool and manifest merge reports, we discovered that `android:testOnly="true"` is being automatically injected during the build process, likely by the React Native or Expo build toolchain. This appears to be a known issue with local Android builds in Expo/React Native projects.

ATTEMPTED SOLUTIONS:
1. Added `tools:remove="android:testOnly"` in AndroidManifest.xml - Did not work
2. Set `manifestPlaceholders = [testOnly:"false"]` in build.gradle - Did not work
3. Verified all source manifest files have no testOnly attribute - Confirmed
4. Used bundletool to inspect merged manifest - Confirmed testOnly=true is present
5. Performed clean builds multiple times - Issue persists
6. Checked all gradle.properties settings - No testOnly configuration found

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- App Name: SwapMyContact
- Package Name: com.businesscard2025.swapcontactnew
- Current Version Code: 53
- Version Name: 0.2.3
- Build Type: Android App Bundle (.aab)
- Target SDK: 35 (Android 15)
- Build Tools: Gradle 8.10.2, AGP 8.6.0
- Framework: React Native (Expo SDK 52)

AAB CONFIGURATION:
- 16KB page size support: Implemented (LDFLAGS -Wl,-z,max-page-size=16384)
- Signing: Properly signed with upload key
- File size: Approximately 60-80 MB
- Bundle validation: No errors reported by bundletool

ATTEMPTS MADE:
1. Multiple uploads via Google Play Console web interface
2. Verified AAB integrity using bundletool (version 1.17.2)
3. Checked signing configuration and keystore
4. Ensured version codes are incrementing correctly
5. Verified all required permissions and manifest entries
6. Confirmed 16KB page size support for Android 15+
7. Attempted uploads at different times/days
8. Verified build.gradle uses 'release' build type (debuggable = false)
9. Confirmed AndroidManifest.xml has no android:debuggable="true" attribute
10. Checked that android:testOnly is not set to true
11. Built using ./gradlew bundlePlayRelease (not debug variant)
12. Inspected AAB manifest using bundletool - no debuggable flag found

CURRENT STATUS:
- Production track: Last successful upload was version 52
- Internal Testing track: Cannot upload any new versions
- No specific error messages provided during upload process
- Upload appears to process but eventually fails or is rejected

IMPACT:
This issue is blocking our development workflow and preventing us from testing new features (including internationalization improvements and UI enhancements) before production release.

REQUESTED ASSISTANCE:
1. Please confirm if AABs with `android:testOnly="true"` can NEVER be uploaded to ANY track (including Internal Testing)
2. Provide guidance on how to remove this attribute when it's being injected by the build toolchain
3. Clarify if using EAS Build (Expo Application Services) instead of local gradle builds would resolve this issue
4. Confirm whether this is expected behavior or if there's a workaround for React Native/Expo projects
5. Suggest alternative approaches to test new builds if Internal Testing track uploads are blocked

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
- Previous uploads to Production track were successful
- Issue started occurring after multiple consecutive upload attempts
- No changes to developer account or app permissions
- Bundle format validated successfully with bundletool

I would greatly appreciate your urgent assistance in resolving this issue so we can continue delivering updates to our users.

Thank you for your time and support.
